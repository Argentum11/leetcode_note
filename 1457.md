# 1457. Pseudo-Palindromic Paths in a Binary Tree

## Description

Given a binary tree where node values are digits from 1 to 9. A path in the binary tree is said to be pseudo-palindromic if at least one permutation of the node values in the path is a palindrome.

Return the number of pseudo-palindromic paths going from the root node to leaf nodes.

## Example

![binary tree 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/05/06/palindromic_paths_1.png)

|Input|Output|
|-|-|
|root = [2,3,1,3,1,null,1]|2|

![binary tree 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/05/07/palindromic_paths_2.png)

|Input|Output|
|-|-|
|root = [2,1,1,1,3,null,null,null,null,null,1]|2|

|Input|Output|
|-|-|
|root = [9]|1|

## Solution

Instead of counting the occurrence of each node value in a path, and checking the occurrence at the leaf node, it's more memory efficient to use a set and perform the following operations

- add the node value if it doesn't exist in the set
- delete the value if it already exists in the set

```python
def traverse(self, node, odd_nodes: set) -> int:
    new_odd_nodes = odd_nodes.copy()
    if node.val in new_odd_nodes:
        new_odd_nodes.remove(node.val)
    else:
        new_odd_nodes.add(node.val)
    # leaf node
    if not node.left and not node.right:
        return 1 if len(new_odd_nodes) <= 1 else 0
    # non leaf node
    left = self.traverse(node.left, new_odd_nodes) if node.left else 0
    right = self.traverse(node.right, new_odd_nodes) if node.right else 0
    return left + right
def pseudoPalindromicPaths (self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
    return self.traverse(root, set())
```
