# 2149. Rearrange Array Elements by Sign

## Description

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of even length consisting of an equal number of positive and negative integers.

You should rearrange the elements of nums such that the modified array follows the given conditions:

1. Every consecutive pair of integers have opposite signs.
2. For all integers with the same sign, the order in which they were present in nums is preserved.
3. The rearranged array begins with a positive integer.

Return the modified array after rearranging the elements to satisfy the aforementioned conditions.

## Example

|Input|Output|
|-|-|
|nums = [3,1,-2,-5,2,-4]|[3,-2,1,-5,2,-4]|
|nums = [-1,1]|[1,-1]|

## Solution

The basic idea behind the solution is two pointers: one is for the positive integers and the other is for the negative integers. To preserve the same order as mentioned in condition 2, the positive index is orginally in position 0. When we encounter a positive integer, it is placed into the result array, and the positive index moves 2 steps forward to position 2. Subsequent positive integers follows the same rule. The negative index is originally in position 1, and the remaining rules are the same.

```python
def rearrangeArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    positive_index, negative_index = 0, 1
    result = [0] * len(nums)
    for number in nums:
        if number > 0:
            result[positive_index] = number
            positive_index += 2
        else:
            result[negative_index] = number
            negative_index += 2
    return result
```
