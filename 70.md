# 70. Climbing Stairs

## Description

You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

## Example

|Input|Output|
|-|-|
|n = 2|2|
|n = 3|3|

## Solution

Start from the concept of dynamic programming, it appears thats in stair ```k```, there are 3 ways to arrive:

- from stair ```k-2```
  - climb 1 step two times
  - climb 2 steps
- from stair ```k-1```
  - climb 1 step

However, it is important to note that climbing 1 step two times from stair k-2 and climbing 1 step from stair ```k-1``` result in the same way of climbing to the top. This is because when climbing one step once from stair ```k-2```, you end up on stair ```k-1```, hich is already hidden the ways of climbing to stair```k-1```. Consequently, the total ways of climbing to stair ```k``` are the sum of the ways of climbing to stair ```k-2``` and the ways of climbing to stair ```k-1```.

```python
def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
    # Using n+2 blocks ensures that, even when n==1, steps[2] doesn't exceed the array size.
    steps = [0] * (n+2)
    steps[1] = 1
    steps[2] = 2
    for i in range(3, n+1):
        steps[i] = steps[i-2] + steps[i-1]
    return steps[n]
```
