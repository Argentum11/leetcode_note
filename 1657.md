# 1657. Determine if Two Strings Are Close

## Description

Two strings are considered close if you can attain one from the other using the following operations:

- Operation 1: Swap any two existing characters.
  - For example, abcde -> aecdb

- Operation 2: Transform every occurrence of one existing character into another existing character, and do the same with the other character.
  - For example, aacabb -> bbcbaa (all a's turn into b's, and all b's turn into a's)
You can use the operations on either string as many times as necessary.

Given two strings, word1 and word2, return true if word1 and word2 are close, and false otherwise.

## Example

|Input|Output|
|-|-|
|word1 = "abc", word2 = "bca"|true|

Apply Operation 1 ( swap b and c): "abc" -> "acb"

|Input|Output|
|-|-|
|word1 = "a", word2 = "aa"|false|

|Input|Output|
|-|-|
|word1 = "cabbba", word2 = "abbccc"|true|

Apply Operation 1: "cabbba" -> "caabbb"

Apply Operation 2: "caabbb" -> "baaccc"

Apply Operation 2: "baaccc" -> "abbccc"

## Solution

In both operations, it is impossible to add a new character. Therefore, first and foremost, we need to check if both words are of the same length. Secondly, we need to verify if there are any characters that exist in word2 but doesn't exist in word1 (in operation 2, characters can only be transformed into existing characters). Now we can proceed to check if word2 can be created using operation 2.

In example 3, the amount of alphabets of word1 are as folllows,

|a|b|c|
|-|-|-|
|2|3|1|

the amount of alphabets of word2 are as folllows, 
|a|b|c|
|-|-|-|
|1|2|3|

while the amount of alphabets of each alphabet change, the sequence of the sorted amounts remains the same ( still [1, 2, 3] ). Therefore, we can utilize the dictionay from the second step, turn it into a sorted listed and check if two sorted lists are the same.

```python
def alphabet_record(self, word: str) -> dict:
        word_alphabet_record = defaultdict(int)
        for char in word:
            word_alphabet_record[char] += 1
        return word_alphabet_record
def same_set_of_alphabets(self, dict_1: dict, dict_2) -> bool:
    for alphabet in dict_2.keys():
        if dict_1[alphabet] == 0:
            return False
    return True
def turn_dict_to_list(self, word_alphabet_record:dict) -> list:
    amount_list = []
    for alphabet_amount in word_alphabet_record.values():
        amount_list.append(alphabet_amount)
    return amount_list
def closeStrings(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> bool:
    if len(word1) != len(word2):
        return False
    word_1_aplhabet_record = self.alphabet_record(word1)
    word_2_aplhabet_record = self.alphabet_record(word2)
    if not self.same_set_of_alphabets(word_1_aplhabet_record, word_2_aplhabet_record):
        return False
    word1_alphabet_amount_list = self.turn_dict_to_list(word_1_aplhabet_record)
    word2_alphabet_amount_list = self.turn_dict_to_list(word_2_aplhabet_record)
    word1_alphabet_amount_list.sort()
    word2_alphabet_amount_list.sort()
    for i in range(len(word1_alphabet_amount_list)):
        if word1_alphabet_amount_list[i] != word2_alphabet_amount_list[i]:
            return False
    return True
```
