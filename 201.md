# 201. Bitwise AND of Numbers Range

## Description

Given two integers left and right that represent the range [left, right], return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.

## Example

|Input|Output|
|-|-|
|left = 5, right = 7|4|
|left = 0, right = 0|0|
|left = 1, right = 2147483647|0|

## Solution

|numbers|
|-|
|110110abcd|
|...|
|1101101111|
|1101110000|
|...|
|110111efgh|

Between numbers ```110110abcd```(left) and ```110111efgh```(right), two numbers can be found: ```1101101111``` and ```1101110000```. The bitwise AND result of ```1101101111``` and ```1101110000``` is ```110110000```, which is the combination of 11011(the part while left and right are the same) and 0000(the remaining bits while left and right are not exactly the same). Consequently, the bitwise AND result of ```110110000``` with other numbers in the specified range is calculated as ```110110000```. Hence, the result of the performing bitwise AND on all numbers in the range is retain the bits while left and right are the same, and set the rest to 0.

```python
def rangeBitwiseAnd(self, left: int, right: int) -> int:
    same_bit_amount = 0
    while left!=right:
        left = left>>1
        right = right>>1
        same_bit_amount += 1
    return left<<same_bit_amount
```
