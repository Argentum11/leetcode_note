# 2870. Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Empty

## Description

You are given a 0-indexed array nums consisting of positive integers.

There are two types of operations that you can apply on the array any number of times:

- Choose two elements with equal values and delete them from the array.
- Choose three elements with equal values and delete them from the array.
- Return the minimum number of operations required to make the array empty, or -1 if it is not possible.

## Example

|Input|Output|
|-|-|
|nums = [2,3,3,2,2,4,2,3,4]|4|
|nums = [2,1,2,2,3,3]|-1|

## Solution

To minimize the number of operations, you should do as many operation 2 (which is "choose 3 elements with equal values ...") as possible. The amount of a number could be categorized into 3 groups, 3n, 3n+1 and 3n+2. Group 3n can be divided by 3, but for 3n+1 and 3n+2

|numbers|3n-3|3n-2|3n-1|3n|3n+1|3n+2|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|can be divided by 3|v|||v|||

- 3n+1
  - from the table above, you can delete 2 elements twice, which is 3n+1-4 = 3n-3, and 3n-3 can be deleted completely using operation 2
  - the only chances of returning -1 is when there is only a element
- 3n+2
  - from the table above, you can delete 2 elements, which is 3n+2-2 = 3n, and 3n can be deleted completely using operation 2

```python
def minOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    record = defaultdict(int)
    for number in nums:
        record[number] += 1
    operations = 0
    for amount in record.values():
        if amount % 3 == 0:
            operations += amount/3
        elif amount % 3 == 1:
            if amount == 1:
                return -1
            else:
                operations += 2 + (amount-4)/3
        else: #amount % 3 == 2
            operations += 1 + (amount-2)/3
    return int(operations)
```
