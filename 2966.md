# 2966. Divide Array Into Arrays With Max Difference

## Description

You are given an integer array nums of size n and a positive integer k.

Divide the array into one or more arrays of size 3 satisfying the following conditions:

- Each element of nums should be in exactly one array.
- The difference between any two elements in one array is less than or equal to k.

Return a 2D array containing all the arrays. If it is impossible to satisfy the conditions, return an empty array. And if there are multiple answers, return any of them.

## Example

|Input|Output|
|-|-|
|nums = [1,3,4,8,7,9,3,5,1], k = 2|[[1,1,3],[3,4,5],[7,8,9]]|
|nums = [1,3,3,2,7,3], k = 3|[]|

## Solution

After sorting the ```nums``` array, the numbers should exhibit less difference to its neighbors than the origin array, then all we need to do is to check if there is a possible answer.

```python
def divideArray(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    max_difference = k
    amount_of_numbers = len(nums)
    sub_arrays = []
    nums.sort()
    for i in range(0, amount_of_numbers, 3):
        if nums[i+2] - nums[i] > max_difference:
            return []
        else:
            sub_arrays.append([nums[i], nums[i+1], nums[i+2]])
    return sub_arrays

```
