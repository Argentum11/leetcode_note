# 13. Roman to Integer

## Description

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

|Symbol|Value|
|-|-|
|I|1|
|V|5|
|X|10|
|L|50|
|C|100|
|D|500|
|M|1000|

For example,

- 2 is written as ```II``` in Roman numeral, just two ones added together
- 12 is written as ```XII```, which is simply ```X```+ ```II```
- 27 is written as ```XXVII```, which is ```XX``` + ```V```+ ```II```.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not ```IIII```. Instead, the number four is written as ```IV```. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as ```IX```. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- ```I``` can be placed before ```V``` (5) and ```X``` (10) to make 4 and 9.
- ```X``` can be placed before ```L``` (50) and ```C``` (100) to make 40 and 90.
- ```C``` can be placed before ```D``` (500) and ```M``` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

## Example

|Input|Output|
|-|-|
|s = "III"|3|
|s = "LVIII"|58|
|s = "MCMXCIV"|1994|

## Solution

For Roman numerals that do not require subtraction, the symbols are sorted in descending order by value. Subtraction is only performed when encountering an ascending order, while addition is applied for the rest.

```python
def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
    value = {"I": 1,
            "V": 5,
            "X": 10,
            "L": 50,
            "C": 100,
            "D": 500,
            "M": 1000}
    string_length = len(s)
    sum = 0
    for i in range(string_length):
        if i <= string_length-2 and value[s[i]] < value[s[i+1]]:
            sum -= value[s[i]]
        else:
            sum += value[s[i]]     
    return sum
```
