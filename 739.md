# 739. Daily Temperatures

## Description

Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

## Example

|Input|Output|
|-|-|
|temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]|[1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]|
|temperatures = [30,40,50,60]|[1,1,1,0]|
|temperatures = [30,60,90]|[1,1,0]|

## Solution

The main idea of this solution is to add descending temperatures to the stack. When a higher temperature occurs, we pop all previous temperatures that are lower than the higher temperature, and the days for waiting for a higher temperature is calculated by subtracting the index difference between the higher temperature and the lower temperature.

```python
def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    days = len(temperatures)
    wait_days = [0] * days
    stack = []
    for current_index, temperature in enumerate(temperatures):
        while stack and temperature > temperatures[stack[-1]]:
            previous_index = stack.pop()
            wait_days[previous_index] = current_index - previous_index
        stack.append(current_index)
    return wait_days

```
