# 169. Majority Element

## Description

Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n/2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

## Example

|Input|Output|
|-|-|
|nums = [3,2,3]|3|
|nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]|2|

## Solution

The core concept is the Boyer-Moore voting algorithm. While the majority element appears more than ```n/2``` times, there are insufficient elements to reduce the ```amount``` variable to zero. Consequently, the ```amount``` variable will be positive, ensuring the candidate element won't be changed after fidentifying the majority element.

```python
def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    candidate_element = None
    amount = 0
    for element in nums:
        if amount == 0:
            candidate_element = element
            amount = 1
        elif element == candidate_element:
            amount += 1
        else:
            amount -= 1
    return candidate_element
```
