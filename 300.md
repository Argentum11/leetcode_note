# 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence

## Description

Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

## Example

|Input|Output|
|-|-|
|nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]|4|
|nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]|4|
|nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]|1|

## Solution

The basic idea of this solution is dynamic programming. We start from the first element to the last element, checking each pair if the pair follows the rule of strictly increasing subsequense, then compare if the new sequence is longer than the current one.

```python
def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    amount_of_numbers = len(nums)
    LIS = [1] * amount_of_numbers
    for i in range(amount_of_numbers):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                LIS[i] = max(LIS[j] + 1, LIS[i])
    return max(LIS)
```
