# 1026. Maximum Difference Between Node and Ancestor

## Description

Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum value v for which there exist different nodes a and b where v = |a.val - b.val| and a is an ancestor of b.

A node a is an ancestor of b if either: any child of a is equal to b or any child of a is an ancestor of b.

## Example

![tree 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/09/tmp-tree.jpg)
|Input|Output|
|-|-|
|root = [8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]|7|

![tree 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/09/tmp-tree-1.jpg)

|Input|Output|
|-|-|
|root = [1,null,2,null,0,3]|3|

## Solution

To find the maximum difference Between all tree nodes and its ancestor, the most intuitive way is to calculate all kinds of pair, however it is time consuming. A better way is as follows, for each node

1. find the the minimum and maximum node in the subtree and calculate the maximum distance with the current node involved
2. using dfs to find the maximum distance for its left subtree and right subtree
3. return the maximum between
    - maximum distance with the current node involved
    - maximum distance in the left subtree
    - maximum distance in the right subtree

```python
def subtree_min_and_max(self, root):
    if not root:
        return float('inf'), float('-inf')

    # left subtree
    left_subtree_min, left_subtree_max = self.subtree_min_and_max(root.left)

    # right subtree
    right_subtree_min, right_subtree_max = self.subtree_min_and_max(root.right)

    # whole tree, including the root node
    tree_min = min(root.val, left_subtree_min, right_subtree_min)
    tree_max = max(root.val, left_subtree_max, right_subtree_max)

    return tree_min, tree_max
        
def maxAncestorDiff(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
    if not root:
        return 0
    current_tree_min, current_tree_max = self.subtree_min_and_max(root)
    difference_between_max = abs(current_tree_max - root.val)
    difference_between_min = abs(current_tree_min - root.val)
    current_max_difference = max(difference_between_min, difference_between_max)
    difference_left = self.maxAncestorDiff(root.left)
    difference_right = self.maxAncestorDiff(root.right)
    return max(difference_left, difference_right, current_max_difference)
```
