# 1758. Minimum Changes To Make Alternating Binary String

## Description

You are given a string s consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. In one operation, you can change any '0' to '1' or vice versa.

The string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters are equal. For example, the string "010" is alternating, while the string "0100" is not.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make s alternating.

## Example

|Input|Output|
|-|-|
|s = "0100"|1|
|s = "10"|0|
|s = "1111"|2|

## Solution

Since there is only 0's and 1's, the are only two results of a alternating string, which is

1. start from 0 (represented as 0-start for the following)
2. start from 1 (represented as 1-start for the following)

But in fact, there is no need to count it twice. By examining the table below, the characters in 0-start change while 1-start doesn't change, making the sum equal to the string length. Therefore, you only need to count it once, regardless of whether you start from 0 or 1. You can obtain the other count by subtracting the length from the one you initially calculated.

|s      |1|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|0-start|0|1|0|1|0|1|0|1|
|       |v|v| | | |v|v|v|
|1-start|1|0|1|0|1|0|1|0|
|       | | |v|v|v| | | |

```python
def minOperations(self, s: str) -> int:
    # turn string into list
    char_amount = len(s)
    numbers = []
    for i in range(char_amount):
        numbers.append(int(s[i]))

    # count operations - starts from 0
    starts_from_0_operations = 0
    next_number = 0
    for i in range(0, char_amount):
        if numbers[i] != next_number:
            starts_from_0_operations += 1
        next_number = 1 - next_number

    # count operations - starts from 1
    starts_from_1_operations = char_amount - starts_from_0_operations
    
    return min(starts_from_0_operations, starts_from_1_operations)
```
