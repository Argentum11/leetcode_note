# 543. Diameter of Binary Tree

## Description

Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

## Example

|Input|Output|
|-|-|
|root = [1,2,3,4,5]|3|
|root = [1,2]|1|

## Solution

The longest path doesn't necessarily require passing through the tree root. Therefore, you should check each node. If the longest path passing through a particular node is greater than the current longest path, update the value.

```python
def depth(self, node: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if not node:
            return 0
        else:
            left_depth = self.depth(node.left)
            right_depth = self.depth(node.right)
            self.diameter = max(self.diameter, left_depth + right_depth)
            return 1 + max(left_depth, right_depth)

    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        self.diameter = 0
        root_depth = self.depth(root)
        return self.diameter
```
